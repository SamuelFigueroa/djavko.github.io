# Teaching

At the University of Kansas, I teach Medicinal Biochemistry, [MDCM601](/courses/mdcm601), which is an introductory biochemistry course for PharmD students. Students in this course learn about:
1. Structure of biological molecular building blocks (amino acids)
2. Structures and functions of proteins
3. Fundamental chemical transformations
4. Enzymes and kinetics
5. Enzyme inhibition

I also co-teach graduate student courses ([MDCM710](/courses/mdcm710), and [MDCM790](/courses/mdcm790/mdcm790)) for PhD and MSc students in the [Department of Medicinal Chemistry](https://medchem.ku.edu). My topics are:
1. Biophysical methods for discovery of bioactive compounds
2. Data centric view of xenobiotic metabolism
3. Cancer therapeutics

The team and I engage in informal study sessions on a weekly basis. Primarily we are focused on the following broad areas:
1. Organic syntheses
2. Coding in [Python](/colab_notebooks) and MatLab
3. Linear algebra applications in chemistry: linear models, reaction kinetics, solutions to differential equations, molecular graphs, eigenvectors, singular value decomposition, group theory.
