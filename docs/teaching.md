At the University of Kansas, I teach Medicinal Biochemistry, MDCM601, which is an introductory biochemistry course for PharmD students. Students in this course learn about:
1. Structure of biological molecular building blocks (amino acids)
2. Structures and functions of proteins
3. Fundamental chemical transformations
4. Enzymes and kinetics
5. Enzyme inhibition

I also co-teach graduate student courses for PhD and MSc students in the [Department of Medicinal Chemistry](medchem.ku.edu). My topics are:
1. Biophysical methods for discovery of bioactive compounds
2. Data centric view of xenobiotic metabolism
3. Cancer therapeutics
