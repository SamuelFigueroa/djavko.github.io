*Biography:*

I got my undergraduate degree from the [University of Nis](https://www.ni.ac.rs/en/), Serbia, doing research on mathematical chemistry with [Ivan Gutman](https://www.pmf.kg.ac.rs/gutman/) and on isolation and analysis of secondary metabolites with [Gordana Stojanovic](http://tesla.pmf.ni.ac.rs/people/hemija/gocas/CVGocaS.htm).

For my PhD work I performed research at the [UCSB chemistry](https://chem.ucsb.edu) with [Bruce Lipshutz](https://lipshutz.chem.ucsb.edu/) working primarily on copper hydride initiated reactions, catalysis, and stereoselective synthetic organic methods.

I continued  postdoctoral research with [Stuart Schreiber](https://www.broadinstitute.org/schreiber-lab) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org) working on delineating molecular mechanism of action of several screening hits, and on design of new chemistry for diverse collections of complex small molecules.

I joined the faculty of the Department of [Medicinal Chemistry](https://medchem.ku.edu) at the [University of Kansas](https://ku.edu) in 2018.
