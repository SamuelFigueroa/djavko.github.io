## MDCM601

1. Structures of building blocks: amino acids, therapeutics
2. Equilibria: acidity, diffusion
3. Protein structure and function
4. Protein translation and trafficking
5. Enzymes and inhibition
6. Kinetics 

### Chemlets
[Chemlets](/courses/mdcm601/chemlets/chemlets.html) represent exercises built using HTML and Javascript integrated with RDKit that increase undergraduate and professional studentsâ€™ exposure to molecular structures. The benefits of this educational tool are instantaneous feedback, a   
multitude of easily generated examples, and streamlined algorithms for thinking about chemistry. Initially, chemlets will cover i) Resonance structures; ii) Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules;
iii) Functional groups; iv) Protonation and deprotonation.
