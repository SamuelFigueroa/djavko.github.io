            <p>
                Move electrons within conjugated systems present in molecules 
                to find as many resonance contributors as possible.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    learn to quickly identify conjugated sytems in structural diagrams.
                </li>
                <li>
                    learn which resonance structures contribute most to the stability of molecules.
                </li>
                <li>
                    understand that the actual structure is a hybrid of all its resonance contributors.

            <p>
                Follow the most commonly used CIP (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog) rules to determine the absolute configuration
                of stereocenters present in a molecule.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    identify which atoms in a molecule are stereocenters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    practice the use of CIP rules to determine which of the possibly many stereoisomers is being shown to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    understand how 3D information about a molecule is presented in structural diagrams.
