## Mutations

> Mutation is a change in a genome.

### Classification of mutations
What types of mutations are there?
* Large scale mutations (chromosome abnormalities):
	* polyploidy: sets of chromosomes are duplicated
	* amplifications or gene duplications
	* deletions: loss of entire chromosomal regions
	* chromosomal rearrangements:
		* inversions
		* translocations
	* loss of heterozygosity: in diploid cells, we have two copies of each gene, somewhat different as inherited from parents; if we lose one, this is different from homozygosity which means identical two copies of a gene.
* Small scale mutations:
	* insertions of nucleotides; results in frameshift
	* deletions
	* substitutions
		* synonymous (same amino acid encoded)
		* non-synonymous
			* missense (different amino acid encoded)
			* nonsense (premature termination)

### Consequences of mutations for cancer
* mutations that cause uncontrolled growth and multiplication of cells
* and other mutations that block the normal defenses that protect against unnatural growth.
