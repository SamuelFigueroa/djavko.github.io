## Hallmarks of cancer

Bob Weinberg's original [list](https://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)81683-9):
1. sustaining proliferative signaling;
2. evading growth suppressors;
3. enabling replicative immortality;
4. activating invasion and metastasis;
5. inducing angiogenesis and
6. resisting cell death.

Expanded set of hallmarks of cancer:
1. sustaining proliferative signaling;
2. evading growth suppressors;
3. **avoiding immune destruction**
4. enabling replicative immortality;
5. **tumor-promoting inflammation**
6. activating invasion and metastasis;
7. inducing angiogenesis
8. **genome instability and mutation**
9. resisting cell death
10. **deregulating cellular energetics**

### Questions
1. Give examples for each hallmark and how it can be used for developing therapies.
2. What is the major criticism of such a list of hallmarks in the context of cancer?
