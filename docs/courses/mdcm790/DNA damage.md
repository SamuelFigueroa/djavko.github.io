DNA is susceptible to a variety of chemical modifications that may damage it.

* chemicals, viruses, and ionizing radiation can all cause damage to DNA
* oxidation, nitrosylation, and alkylation of the DNA heterocyclic base
* phosphodiester linkage break
* 10 <sup>4</sup> – 10 <sup>5</sup> events per cell per day

### Cells detect damage to DNA and attempt repairs
* DNA damage response (DDR) can be:
	* nucleotide excision repair (NER)
	* base excision repair (BER), and
	* non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)

### Therapeutics that deliberately cause DNA damage

1. [Alkylating agents](Alkylating agents.md)
2. [Coordinating metals](Cis-platin.md)
3. [Intercalators](Actinomycin.md)
