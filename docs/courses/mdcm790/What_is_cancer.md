**Cancer is uncontrolled cell growth.**

Life cycle of a cell is tightly controlled. Orderly cell death is called [apoptosis](apoptosis) (second p is silent).

Cancer has been often categorized according to the tissue where itâ€™s found. This is why you may often hear about:
* ovarian cancer
* lung cancer
* breast cancer
* testicular cancer
* prostate cancer
* esophageal cancer
* intestinal cancer

It may be better to define it by the [cancer driver mutations](mutations.md).
