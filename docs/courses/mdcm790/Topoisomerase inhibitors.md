**Topoisomerase inhibitors are chemical compounds that block the action ofÂ [topoisomerases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase "Topoisomerase").**

* Intercalating drugs are used for cancer chemotherapy because they poison cells that are rapidly dividing, like the cells in a growing tumor
	* Action of [topoisomerase](Topoisomerase) begins by breaking one of DNA strands
	* then they induce a topological change in DNA such as relaxing supercoils or untangling strands
	* and finally they reconnect the DNA in its proper form.
* Intercalating drugs block the reconnection step, freezing the topoisomerase after it has broken the DNA.
* This is a problem for a dividing cell: when a replication fork reaches the site, a lethal double-strand break is formed as the replication machinery passes through the damaged DNA.

### Examples
1. [Camptothecins](camptothecin)
2. [Etoposide](etoposide)
3. [Doxorubicine](doxorubicine)
