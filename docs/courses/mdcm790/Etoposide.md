### Mechanism of action
Etoposide forms a ternary complex with [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") and the [topoisomerase II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topoisomerase_II "Topoisomerase II") enzyme, which is an enzyme that aids in relaxing negative or positive [supercoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercoil "Supercoil") in DNA. Topoisomerase II normally will form a double-stranded break in one DNA double-strand, allow another to pass through, and [re-ligate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligation_(molecular_biology) "Ligation (molecular biology)") the broken strands. Etoposide's binding prevents topoisomerase II from [re-ligating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligation_(molecular_biology) "Ligation (molecular biology)") the broken DNA strands, which causes the DNA breaks made by topoisomerase II to stay broken, and also prevents the topoisomerase II molecule from leaving the site and relieving tension elsewhere. This results in a double-strand break in the DNA that can have various deleterious effects on the cell, and depletion of topoisomerase II available to relieve further tension.
