## Microtubules

* Microtubules are the railways of the cell
* They are huge, sturdy filaments that extend through the cytoplasm, providing support and providing tracks for the motion of two types of protein motors: [kinesin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesin) and [dynein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynein). These motors pull many types of cargo through the cell, ranging from small vesicles to entire mitochondria.
* They also play a key role in the process of cell division, separating the duplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells.
