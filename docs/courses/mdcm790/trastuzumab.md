## Trastazumab

* antibody
* breast cancer
* human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, aka ErbB2)
* receptor tyrosine kinase
* two conformations:
	* tethered (self-protected)
	* extended; usually, once signal binds, the receptor opens up and can link with other receptors and initiate signaling; HER2 doesn't need a signal so it can always be extended

* ![trastuzumab](https://cdn.rcsb.org/pdb101/motm/268/Figure2.jpg)
* resistance develops
* pertuzumab is another antibody
* binds away from the membrane and prevents heterodimerization with HER3
