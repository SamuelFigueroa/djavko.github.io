The combination of chemotherapeutic agents is delivered cyclically based on the three basic principles.

1.  Fraction kill hypothesis: A uniform drug dose kills a constant fraction of tumor cells rather than a constant number regardless of tumor burden.
2.  Neoplastic tumor cells have a linear response between the dose administered and the efficacy.
3.  Goldie-Coldman hypothesis: Cancer cells acquire spontaneous mutations that cause drug resistance.
