### IDH
Isocitrate dehydrogenase is a metabolic enzyme that is mutated in some cancers such that instead of the native reaction (isocitrate to alpha keto glutarate), it catalyzes the further reduction of alpha-keto glutarate to 2-hydroxy glutarate. This causes depletion of an important co-factor (alpha-KG) for the iron-dependent enzymes that catalyze removal of methyl groups from histones or DNA. Thus, DNA stays hyper-methylated which is often associated with cancer. In addition, 2-HG has numerous cancer-activating effects, such as cellular metabolism.
