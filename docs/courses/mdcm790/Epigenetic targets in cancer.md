## Epigenetic targets in cancer

[Overview](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1805035#:~:text=Epigenetic%20therapies%20seek%20to%20normalize,or%20maintain%20a%20malignant%20phenotype.) of epiegenetic therapies for cancer.

> Chromatin remains an important therapeutic target. The activity of established and investigational epigenetic therapies in well-defined clinical contexts has provided evidence that this strategy can be effective. Given the sheer number of potential targets, a systematic approach that identifies and validates potential drug targets is needed to focus drug development and achieve the promise of this strategy.



### DNA modifications

Aberrant DNA methylation, for example, has emerged as a recurring oncogenic event.

### IDH
Isocitrate dehydrogenase is a metabolic enzyme that is mutated in some cancers such that instead of the native reaction (isocitrate to alpha keto glutarate), it catalyzes the further reduction of alpha-keto glutarate to 2-hydroxy glutarate. This causes depletion of an important co-factor (alpha-KG) for the iron-dependent enzymes that catalyze removal of methyl groups from histones or DNA. Thus, DNA stays hyper-methylated which is often associated with cancer. In addition, 2-HG has numerous cancer-activating effects, such as cellular metabolism.
