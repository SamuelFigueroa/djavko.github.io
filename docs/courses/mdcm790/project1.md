## Mutations at the drug binding sites

Task: 
1. Choose a cancer drug whose protein target is known.
2. Find a crystal structure of the drug binding to its protein target and open the structure in PyMOL.
3. Inspect the binding site and select the residues near the drug binding site.
4. Search the literature for common mutations in the target protein that cause resistance to the cancer drug. 
5. Map these amino acids to the protein.
6. Discuss. 
7. Repeat for another cancer drug.
