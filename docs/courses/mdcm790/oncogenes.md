* Abl is a [[cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase]]
* Src is [[cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase]]
* YAP is a [[transcriptional coactivator]]
* PDGF is a [[growth factor]] or mitogen
* Raf is a [[cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase]]
* CDK is a [[cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase]]

Tumor-suppressor genes:
* Rb controls [[DNA Replication, cell division and death]]
* p53 controls [apoptosis](apoptosis.md)
* BCL2 controls [apoptosis](apoptosis.md)
* VHL controls [[Cell differentiation]]
* BRCA2 controls [[Cell division and death, and repair of double-stranded DNA breaks]]
* SWI/SNF [[chromatin remodeling]]
