## Actinomycin

* [Actonomycin D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactinomycin)
* Natural product.
* intercalates into DNA
* Actinomycin D does this by binding [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA") at the transcription initiation complex and preventing elongation of [RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA "RNA") chain by [RNA polymerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_polymerase "RNA polymerase").
* PDB: [173d](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/173d)
* 7-amino actinomycin D is a fluorescent analog probe compound useful for flow cytometry or staining
	* almost 100 nm Stokes shift
* for treatment of:
	* rhabdomyosarcoma
	* Wilm's tumor (How is tumor different from cancer? Are there cancers that are not tumors? Are all tumors cancers?)
