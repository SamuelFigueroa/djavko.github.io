## Cyclin-dependent kinases

* division of cells is highly regulated
* cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases control cell division
* [[cell cycle]]
* cyclins are kept low through protein degradation (ubiquitine-proteasome system)
* when needed, cyclin binds CDK, kinase phosphorylates itself and starts phosphorylating other proteins

	* [PDB 1fin](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1FIN) ; cyclin bound to CDK
	* [PDB 1qmz](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1qmz) cyclin+CDK+peptide target
	* [PDB 1bi7](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1BI7) CDK+INK proteins (if DNA is damaged and needs to be repaired prior to DNA replication in S phase)
	* [PDB 1jsu](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1JSU) CDK + Kip protein that prevents ATP from binding
