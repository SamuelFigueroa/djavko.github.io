## Cyclin-dependent kinases

* division of cells is highly regulated
* cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases control cell division
* [[cell cycle]]
* cyclins are kept low through protein degradation (ubiquitine-proteasome system)
* when needed, cyclin binds CDK, kinase phosphorylates itself and starts phosphorylating other proteins
* https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/236
	* PDB: 1fin ; cyclin bound to CDK
	* 1qmz cyclin+CDK+peptide target
	* 1bi7 CDK+INK proteins (if DNA is damaged and needs to be repaired prior to DNA replication in S phase)
	* 1jsu CDK + Kip protein that prevents ATP from binding

What are some small molecule CDK6 inhibitors?
