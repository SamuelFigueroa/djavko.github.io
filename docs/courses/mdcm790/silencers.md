## Silencers

* negative regulatory elements that repress gene activity.
* they loop to their target promoter ([75](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035537#), [120](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035537#)), establishing repressive chromatin marks in the region in which they reside ([115](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035537#)),
* or they competing for [[Transcription factor]] binding with the promoter ([56](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035537#), [79](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-091416-035537#)).
* Because of the lack of an efficient functional assay to characterize silencers, not much is known about these elements.
