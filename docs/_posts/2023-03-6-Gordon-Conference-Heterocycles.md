Last year, I attended for the first time one of the Gordon Conferences. This year, from June 18-23, I will be a Discussion Leader at the Heterocyclic Compounds GRC. [Catharine Larsen](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/catharl) from UC Riverside and Eric Voight from AbbVie will be the chair and co-chair this year.

This particular GRC is hosted at the scenic campus of the Salve Regina University on the Atlantic coast, near Newport, Rhode Island.  

Please, join the industry and academic chemists broadly interested in different aspects of chemistry of heterocycles (synthesis, natural or un-natural, catalysis, mechanisms, etc.).
