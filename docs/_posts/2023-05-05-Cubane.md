title: Cubanes and geometric algebra
---

The flat hexagon of a benzene is one of the first structures we encounter in organic chemistry and it stays with us for a while. If out of six positions on the ring two are different than the other four, we encounter first example of regioisomers; when substitents are adjacent we call this the *ortho* isomer, when there is one carbon between this is *meta*, and if they are two carbons away, *para* isomer. Since this entire system is in a plane, it's fairly obvious to see that the angle between the substituents in the *ortho* isomer is 60 degrees (or $ \pi/3 $), if they are *meta* it is 120 or $ 2\pi/3 $ and if they are *para*, the angle is 180 (or $ \pi $). 

Now everyone wants to "escape the flatland" and chemists figured that there is some resemblance  between the flat benzene and decidedly three-dimensional cubane. Recently, [MacMillan and collaborators](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06021-8) published a technique to derivatize cubanes and I wondered what is the angle between the adjacent positions in cubane, the ones that are a face-diagonal away, and the ones that are the main diagonal away. You can see that if cubane is analogous to benzene and one of the verices is substituted, than there can be three "*ortho*" positions, 3 "*meta*" positions, and one "*para*" position. This is nice, but what is really the angle between these bonds?

Luckily, this can be easily done with some simple geometric algebra, or in this case just the scalar product between vectors will do. Thus we define:

$$ a = \frac{(x_1-x_2-x_3)}{\sqrt{3}} $$

and 

$$ b = \frac{(x_1+x_2+x_3)}{\sqrt{3}} $$

and then

$$ a \cdot b = \cos{\theta} = -1/3 $$

And the angle between a and b is 109.5, which we know as the angle of a tetrahedral carbon. This is unsurprising if we remember that the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube exactly by connecting the four vertices with the diagonals of the faces.





### Side note on "three-dimensionality" of molecules
Three-dimensionaly of cubane is undisputed because cubane actually encloses a space (that is there is an inside and outside), unlike many other compounds which even if they are rich in stereocenters can still be flattened out without any loss in information about connecitivity, and they are therefore at least topologically two-dimensional. Try out to famous Euler formula to convince yourself: $ V+F-E=2 $ for a 3D body like a cube, but 1 for a planar object like a square.
