If you will be at the ACS National meeting in Indianapolis in late March, please stop by the New Reactions & Methodology session in Room 201 at the Indiana Convention Center. SESSION TIME: Monday, March 27, 2023, 8:00 AM - 11:40 AM

*UPDATE:*
In case you missed it (there were about two dozen people in the room for the early morning session), here is my [slideshow](/_assets/2023ACSSpring.pdf).
