You must present it so well that they will set aside what they are doing, look at what you’ve done, read it, and come back and say, “Yes, that was good.”

Part of the progression from an assistant professor to an associate professor is a series of talks at various departments across the country (and internationally, depending on one's caliber presumably) that came to be known as the Tenure Tour. 
It is a unique opportunity for a relative "unknown" in the academic world to rapidly make contacts with other faculty, and more importantly to get condensed feedback on their work, ideas, future plans from their peers. 

The plan for my own "tenure tour" is in the table below. If you have an opening and want to hear what my lab has been up to thus far, please feel free to contact me.
